# iv3shells
I &lt;3 Shells (iv3shells) is a script that generates reverse-shells in a quick-and-easy way. It will ask for the information needed (unless given through options), and then copy a command to the clipboard. The main idea behind this script is to simplify the process of creating reverse-shells on a victim while pen-testing.
